## ⌨️Usage Examples

`stash init D:\stash_data --file_name "stash_db.json --currency €`

This initializes the stash CLI. It is important to initialize the tool before first use. This command will store all
accounts and related data in **stash_db.json** file and the currency will be set to €. This currency is set for all
accounts on Stash. Currently, it is not possible to set individual currencies for accounts.

`stash accounts add "John Doe" "johndoe@gmail.com" 1980-05-01`

This creates an account with the Account holder name as **John Doe**, the email address as **johndoe@gmail.com** and John's DOB as **01-05-1980**. A Unqiue ID is also created for this account. It follows the pattern firstnamelastname_dob. In this example, the Unique ID will be **johndoe_151980**.

`stash accounts summary`

Displays all the accounts on Stash with all details of each account and the account balance.

`stash transactions credit johndoe_151980 1000 --desc "Initial transaction"`

This creates a CREDIT transaction and adds money to John's account. A transaction ID is created (UNIX timestamp). The Date, time, description, type and amount is recorded in every transaction. A Similar command can be used for DEBIT where the money is removed from an account.

`stash accounts statement johndoe_151980`

This displays all the transactions for John's account. All columns mentioned above for the credit example are all displayed in a neat table format.

`stash transactions delete johndoe_151980 1751128581`

This removes a transaction from John's account which has a unique ID **1751128581**. Balance for the account is updated accordingly.
